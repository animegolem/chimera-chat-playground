# Issues 

## Code Blocks 

- [x] Code blocks do not render correctly or line wrap, the CSS needs to be updated to match lexical implementation. 
- [x] you can backspace into white-space and it will merge text into the code block. There is no trivial way to remove it. This should be blocked.

## Message History

- [x] Sometimes after a message is sent the autoscroll to latest message behavior fails open and forces it down repeatedly preventing any scroll up. 

## Misc 

- [x] Opening and closing the sidebar has jarring pop in as elements load in at unique rates are we able to hide the stream in with as single loading spin that soft fades into the app over half a second or so?
