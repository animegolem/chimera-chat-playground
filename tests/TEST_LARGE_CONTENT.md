# Testing Large Content Multiple-Send Fix

## Test Setup

1. **Load the extension** in Firefox:
   - Navigate to `about:debugging`
   - Click "This Firefox" 
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
   - Select any file in the `dist/` folder

2. **Open extension sidebar**:
   - Visit any webpage
   - Open the extension sidebar (check extension UI)

## Test Cases

### Case 1: Normal Message (Baseline)
1. Type a short message: "This is a test message"
2. Press Ctrl+Enter or click Send button
3. **Expected**: Console logs show single `handleSend_start` with unique sendId
4. **Expected**: Message sends once

### Case 2: Large Reddit Content (Original Bug)
1. Open browser DevTools console to see debug logs
2. Copy this large content and paste into editor:

3. Press Ctrl+Enter or click Send button
4. **Watch console logs** for debug output

## Expected Results

### Debug Log Pattern (Success)
You should see logs like:
```
[ContentTest] handleSend_start { sendId: "abc123", loading: false, isSending: false, timestamp: 1234567890 }
[ContentTest] handleSend_locked { sendId: "abc123", lockSet: true, elapsed: 2 }
[ContentTest] handleSend_getText { sendId: "abc123", textLength: 2847, hasText: true, elapsed: 5 }
[ContentTest] handleSend_sending { sendId: "abc123", textLength: 2847, modelCount: 1, elapsed: 8 }
[ContentTest] handleSend_sent { sendId: "abc123", elapsed: 1234 }
[ContentTest] handleSend_complete { sendId: "abc123", totalElapsed: 1250 }
[ContentTest] handleSend_unlocked { sendId: "abc123", lockReleased: true, elapsed: 1255 }
```

### What Fixed Behavior Looks Like
- **Single sendId**: Only one unique sendId should appear
- **No abort_already_sending**: Should not see "handleSend_abort_already_sending" logs
- **Sequential execution**: All events for one sendId complete before any new sendId appears

### What Broken Behavior Looked Like (Before Fix)
- **Multiple sendIds**: Multiple handleSend_start events with different sendIds  
- **Race conditions**: Overlapping execution with different sendIds
- **Multiple sends**: Same content sent 3x to backend

## Analysis Tools

Use `ContentTestDebugger` in console:
```javascript
// Clear previous logs
ContentTestDebugger.clearLogs();

// After sending, analyze results
ContentTestDebugger.analyzeEventSequence();
// Should return: { duplicateSends: 0, totalSends: 1, timingIssues: false }

// View all logs
ContentTestDebugger.getLogs();
```

## Fix Components

The solution implements:
1. **Synchronous Lock**: `isSendingRef.current` provides immediate race condition prevention
2. **Visual State**: `isSending` state for UI feedback (button disabled, loading indicator)
3. **Early Exit**: Immediate return if already sending based on ref value
4. **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive event tracking with unique IDs
5. **Finally Block**: Ensures both locks are always released

### Key Technical Detail

The critical fix was using `useRef` instead of `useState` for the primary lock:
- **Problem**: `setState` is asynchronous, so multiple rapid calls could all see `isSending: false`
- **Solution**: `useRef` provides synchronous access, so `isSendingRef.current = true` is immediate
- **Result**: Race conditions eliminated at the source

## CSS Layout Fix

A separate issue was fixed where very long AI responses caused white background bleeding:

### Problem
- Large content messages broke CSS layout  
- `whitespace-pre-wrap` without proper word-breaking caused horizontal overflow
- Background containers couldn't contain extremely long words/lines

### Solution
- **Word Breaking**: Added `break-words`, `overflow-wrap: break-word`, and `hyphens: auto`
- **Container Containment**: Added `overflow-hidden` and `contain: layout style`
- **Flex Constraints**: Added `min-width: 0` to prevent flex item expansion
- **Custom CSS Class**: `.message-content` handles all text wrapping scenarios

Both the race condition and CSS layout issues should now be resolved.

## UI Freezing Fix

A third issue was discovered where large content caused the application to appear "locked":

### Problem
- Large content caused `await storage.saveSession()` to block the main thread
- UI appeared frozen during storage serialization of large payloads
- Users couldn't interact with the interface while large content was being saved

### Solution
- **Non-blocking Storage**: Removed `await` from session saving, making it asynchronous
- **Background Save**: Storage now happens in background with error handling
- **Better UI Feedback**: Added loading indicator when `isSending` is true
- **Responsive UI**: Interface remains interactive during large content operations

All three major issues (race conditions, CSS layout, UI freezing) are now fixed.
