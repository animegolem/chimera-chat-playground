# Mystery new model, probably openai "cloaked" for training 

Short answer: you’re missing the “code block editing” behavior that comes from the Code plugin (and its command handlers), not just CodeHighlightPlugin or the Markdown transformer. The Markdown shortcut turns ``` into a CodeNode, but without the code plugin’s key handlers, Enter will split the node instead of inserting a line break inside it.

What to check and fix

1) Include the full Code plugin behavior, not only highlighting
- In the Lexical playground, they use `@lexical/code` utilities and register code-specific key handlers (e.g., handle Enter, Shift+Enter, Escape, Tab).
- If you only use `MarkdownShortcutPlugin` and `CodeHighlightPlugin`, you’re missing the logic that:
  - inserts a newline inside the same `CodeNode` on Enter,
  - exits the code block on double Enter,
  - handles indentation, etc.

Action:
- Add the official Code plugin equivalent (look at the playground’s `CodeActionMenuPlugin`/code-related plugin, or implement the handlers from `@lexical/code`):
  - Call `registerCodeHighlighting(editor)` (you already do)
  - Also register code block key bindings:
    - Enter inside a `CodeNode` should insert a `LineBreakNode` instead of splitting the node or creating a new `CodeNode`.
    - Double Enter exits the `CodeNode`.

Reference points in code:
- `@lexical/code` exports helpers like `getCodeLanguages`, `getDefaultCodeLanguage`, and it shows how to register highlight and key handlers.
- The Playground has a `CodeHighlightPlugin` plus code-specific behavior plugged in via command registrations (e.g., `KEY_ENTER_COMMAND`, `KEY_TAB_COMMAND`) with a check for `isCodeNode(selection.anchor.getNode())`.

2) Ensure `Enter` isn’t intercepted elsewhere
- You mentioned fixing a `KeyDownPlugin` that scrambled insertion. Double-check you don’t still have any key handler that:
  - calls `editor.dispatchCommand(INSERT_PARAGRAPH_COMMAND)` on Enter unconditionally,
  - or returns true and prevents the code plugin’s key handler from running.
- Set your custom Enter handler priority to `LOW` or don’t register it when inside a `CodeNode`.

3) Verify use of `CodeNode` vs `CodeHighlightNode`
- You should register both `CodeNode` and `CodeHighlightNode` in the editor config. The `CodeHighlightNode` subclasses `CodeNode`, but if only one is registered (or registered in the wrong order), key bindings might not match as expected.
- The playground registers both.

4) Theme/CSS is not the cause
- Your DOM snapshot shows correct structure inside a single `CodeNode` (text + line breaks). If you still see multiple `<pre>` elements, it’s very likely your Enter handler is creating a new block. CSS won’t cause separate `<pre>` siblings from a single node.

5) Markdown transformer intent
- The `CODE` transformer in `@lexical/markdown` does handle fenced code blocks (multi-line). It’s not limited to single-line. The transformer’s job is conversion; it doesn’t handle runtime key events. The bug is almost certainly missing runtime key handlers.

Concrete steps to align with the Playground

- Add a Code plugin similar to the Playground:
  - In a React plugin, on mount:
    - call `registerCodeHighlighting(editor)`
    - register `KEY_ENTER_COMMAND` with `COMMAND_PRIORITY_EDITOR` (or `NORMAL`), handler:
      - if selection is inside a `CodeNode`:
        - if last line is empty and Enter pressed again → exit code block
        - else insert `LineBreakNode`
        - return true
      - else return false
    - optionally register `KEY_TAB_COMMAND` and Shift+Tab for indentation inside code blocks.
- Ensure your existing `MarkdownShortcutPlugin` remains, but it should not override Enter when selection is in a code block.
- Confirm that your `TRANSFORMERS` includes `CODE` and that you’re not customizing it to a single-line behavior.

Minimal example outline

- Editor nodes: `[CodeNode, CodeHighlightNode, ...]`
- Plugins:
  - `MarkdownShortcutPlugin({transformers: TRANSFORMERS})`
  - `CodeHighlightPlugin` (your current one)
  - New `CodeEditingPlugin` (custom) that:
    - `useEffect(() => editor.registerCommand(KEY_ENTER_COMMAND, handler, COMMAND_PRIORITY_NORMAL))`
    - In handler: if `isSelectionInsideCodeBlock(selection)`, insert `LineBreakNode` (or call helper from `@lexical/code`) and return true.
  - Optionally `HistoryPlugin`, `RichTextPlugin`, etc.

How to detect “inside a code block”
- Get `const selection = $getSelection()`
- If it’s a range selection, `const node = selection.anchor.getNode()`
- Walk up with `node.getTopLevelElementOrThrow()` or `node.getParentWhile(...)`, check `node.getType() === 'code'` (or `isCodeNode(node)`).

Why your debug structure “looks right” but renders wrong
- If the handler creates a new code block node per Enter, you will see multiple top-level `CodeNode`s. Your printed structure showing line breaks inside a single code node might be from a different run or from early mutations before Enter handler fires again. Inspect the final root children count: you should see exactly one code node while typing multiple lines. If you see multiple code nodes at the root after pressing Enter, that confirms the handler issue.

Answers to your specific questions

- Known limitation? Not of markdown shortcuts. The limitation is that markdown shortcuts only create the node, they don’t implement the code editing UX. You need the code plugin behavior.
- Additional plugins? Yes: a code editing plugin (key handlers) in addition to `CodeHighlightPlugin`.
- Custom transformer? Not needed for multi-line. Keep the built-in `CODE` transformer.
- Config differences vs Playground? The Playground registers code key handlers and utilities from `@lexical/code`. Mirror that setup.

If you want, share your plugin registrations and I can point out exactly where to add the Enter handler and what priority to use.

# Open AI o3 

You’re not missing anything in the Markdown transformers – the missing piece is the command handler that tells Lexical what to do when Enter is pressed inside a `CodeNode`.  
That handler lives in the “code-block” plugin, NOT in `MarkdownShortcutPlugin` and NOT in `CodeHighlightPlugin`.

What’s happening now

1. You create a `CodeNode` with ``` + space.  
2. When you hit Enter, no special handler is registered, so Lexical falls back to the generic `INSERT_LINE_BREAK_COMMAND`.  
3. The generic logic for an ElementNode is “split this node in two”, so a brand-new `CodeNode` is inserted after the current one → every line becomes its own `<pre>` element.

Why the playground works

In the playground they mount two separate plugins:

• `<CodeHighlightPlugin />` – adds syntax colouring.  
• `<CodeBlockPlugin />` – registers the key-commands (`Enter`, `Tab`, `Backspace`, `ArrowUp/Down`) that make a code block behave like a multiline editor.

How to fix it

Option A – just add the missing plugin (preferred)

```typescript
import {MarkdownShortcutPlugin} from '@lexical/react/LexicalMarkdownShortcutPlugin';
import {CodeHighlightPlugin}   from '@lexical/react/LexicalCodeHighlightPlugin';
import {CodeBlockPlugin}       from '@lexical/react/LexicalCodeBlockPlugin';

// …

<MarkdownShortcutPlugin transformers={TRANSFORMERS} />
<CodeHighlightPlugin />
<CodeBlockPlugin />            {/* <- this is the one you don’t have */}
```

Nothing else has to change.  
`CodeBlockPlugin` internally calls `editor.registerCommand(KEY_ENTER_COMMAND, …)` and replaces the default “split node” behaviour with:

• If the current line is empty → exit the block.  
• Otherwise → insert a `LineBreakNode` inside the same `CodeNode`.

Option B – register the commands yourself

If for some reason you don’t want to ship the plugin:

```typescript
import {useLexicalComposerContext} from '@lexical/react/LexicalComposerContext';
import {
  $createLineBreakNode,
  $isCodeNode,
  $getSelection,
  COMMAND_PRIORITY_LOW,
  KEY_ENTER_COMMAND,
  INSERT_PARAGRAPH_COMMAND
} from 'lexical';

function MyCodeBlockEnterHandler() {
  const [editor] = useLexicalComposerContext();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    return editor.registerCommand(
      KEY_ENTER_COMMAND,
      (event) => {
        const selection = $getSelection();
        if (!selection?.isCollapsed()) return false;

        const codeNode = selection.anchor.getNode().getParent();
        if (!$isCodeNode(codeNode)) return false;

        // Empty line -> leave the block
        if (codeNode.getTextContent().slice(selection.anchor.offset - 1).trim() === '') {
          editor.dispatchCommand(INSERT_PARAGRAPH_COMMAND, undefined);
          return true;
        }

        // Normal Enter inside code
        selection.insertNodes([$createLineBreakNode()]);
        return true;
      },
      COMMAND_PRIORITY_LOW
    );
  }, [editor]);

  return null;
}
```

But using the ready-made `CodeBlockPlugin` is simpler and keeps you aligned with upstream changes.

Things that are NOT related to the bug

• Theme classes – they only affect styling.  
• `CodeHighlightPlugin` – colours, no key handling.  
• Markdown transformers – they run when you type “``` ”, not when you press Enter inside the block.

So, drop in `CodeBlockPlugin` (or equivalent command registration) and a single multiline `<pre>` is rendered, just like in the playground.

Based on the detailed information you've provided, this is a classic issue when setting up code blocks in Lexical. Your debugging process has been very thorough and has correctly eliminated several potential causes.

Here is a breakdown of the likely culprit and how to address it, drawing on common Lexical implementation patterns.

### The Core of the Issue: `insertNewAfter` vs. `insertText`

Your hypothesis that `CodeNode.insertNewAfter()` is being called instead of a function that inserts a newline character is likely correct. When you press `Enter` within a `CodeNode`, the default behavior should be to insert a `LineBreakNode` within the *same* `CodeNode`, not to create a new `CodeNode`.

The fact that new `CodeNode`s are being created suggests that the `INSERT_PARAGRAPH` command (which is what `Enter` typically dispatches) is not being handled correctly at the `CodeNode` level. Instead of the `CodeNode` "capturing" the command and adding a newline, the editor is letting it bubble up, resulting in the creation of a new block-level node of the same type.

### Likely Cause and Solution

The most common reason for this behavior is the **lack of a specific command handler for the `Enter` key (or `INSERT_PARAGRAPH` command) when inside a `CodeNode`**. While `CodeHighlightPlugin` handles the syntax highlighting, it does not, by itself, manage the editing behavior like key presses within the node.

To fix this, you need to register a command handler that specifically targets the `INSERT_PARAGRAPH_COMMAND` with a high priority. This handler will check if the current selection is within a `CodeNode` and, if so, insert a newline character, preventing the default behavior.

Here is a conceptual implementation of what's needed, often placed within a component that's a child of your `LexicalComposer`:

```typescript
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useLexicalComposerContext } from '@lexical/react/LexicalComposerContext';
import {
  $getSelection,
  $isRangeSelection,
  COMMAND_PRIORITY_HIGH,
  INSERT_PARAGRAPH_COMMAND,
} from 'lexical';
import { $isCodeNode } from '@lexical/code';

export function CodeBlockEnterKeyPlugin() {
  const [editor] = useLexicalComposerContext();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Register a command listener for the INSERT_PARAGRAPH_COMMAND.
    // We use a high priority to ensure it runs before the default behavior.
    return editor.registerCommand(
      INSERT_PARAGRAPH_COMMAND,
      () => {
        const selection = $getSelection();

        // Check if the selection is a range selection (i.e., has a cursor).
        if ($isRangeSelection(selection)) {
          // Get the node at the anchor of the selection.
          const anchorNode = selection.anchor.getNode();
          
          // Check if the anchor node is a CodeNode or has a CodeNode as a parent.
          const codeNode = anchorNode.getType() === 'code' 
            ? anchorNode 
            : anchorNode.getParent();
            
          if ($isCodeNode(codeNode)) {
            // If we are in a CodeNode, insert a newline character.
            editor.update(() => {
              selection.insertText('\n');
            });
            // Return true to indicate that the command has been handled.
            return true;
          }
        }
        
        // If we're not in a CodeNode, return false to allow the default behavior.
        return false;
      },
      COMMAND_PRIORITY_HIGH
    );
  }, [editor]);

  return null;
}
```

### How to Integrate This Solution

1.  **Create the `CodeBlockEnterKeyPlugin.tsx` file** with the code above.
2.  **Add this new plugin to your editor's component tree**, alongside `MarkdownShortcutPlugin` and `CodeHighlightPlugin`.

```typescript
// Your LexicalEditor.tsx or similar file

// ... other imports
import { CodeBlockEnterKeyPlugin } from './CodeBlockEnterKeyPlugin';

// ... inside your editor component
<LexicalComposer ...>
  <PlainTextPlugin ... />
  <HistoryPlugin />
  <MyToolbarPlugin />
  
  {/* Add the new plugin here */}
  <CodeBlockEnterKeyPlugin />

  <MarkdownShortcutPlugin transformers={TRANSFORMERS} />
  <CodeHighlightPlugin />
  {/* ... other plugins */}
</LexicalComposer>
```

### Addressing Your Other Hypotheses

*   **CODE transformer implementation**: The `CODE` transformer in `@lexical/markdown` is primarily for the initial creation of the code block from the ``` markdown shortcut. It is generally not involved in the subsequent editing of the node's content, so this is unlikely to be the root cause for the `Enter` key behavior.
*   **Missing specialized plugin**: Your hypothesis here was spot on. A plugin to handle `Enter` key logic within the `CodeNode` is precisely what's missing. The official Lexical playground includes such logic.
*   **Theme configuration**: Your TailwindCSS theme for the `code` node (`<pre>`) is for styling and should not interfere with the logical handling of key presses. Removing it is a good debugging step, but it's unlikely to be the cause.
*   **`MarkdownShortcutPlugin` configuration**: This plugin's responsibility is to trigger the transformation. Once the `CodeNode` is created, its internal behavior is governed by the node's implementation and other registered command handlers.

By implementing a dedicated command handler for the `Enter` key within `CodeNode`s, you will effectively "capture" the event and instruct Lexical to add a newline, resulting in the desired multi-line code block behavior you see in the official playground.

# Grok 4

Based on the detailed issue report you provided, I have a pretty good hypothesis about what's going on and how to fix it. I'll break this down step-by-step, including why I think this is happening, how it aligns with Lexical's internals (based on my knowledge of the library), and concrete suggestions to resolve it. I'm drawing from Lexical's source code, common pitfalls in custom setups, and examples like the official playground.

### Quick Summary of My Analysis
- **Core Contradiction in Your Report**: Your debug node structure shows a **single CodeNode with LineBreakNodes and TextNodes** (which is correct and should render as a multi-line `<pre>` with `<br>` separators). But the actual DOM renders as **multiple separate `<pre>` elements**. This suggests one of two things:
  - The debug output might not reflect the *actual* runtime node tree (e.g., it's a manual/logged snapshot from a "fixed" state, but the enter key is still splitting nodes in practice).
  - Or, more likely, the enter key is *splitting* the CodeNode into multiple CodeNodes (one per line), but your debug logging isn't capturing that dynamically.
- **Root Cause Hypothesis**: Lexical doesn't have "built-in" multi-line code block behavior for the enter key out of the box—it's handled by command overrides (e.g., `KEY_ENTER_COMMAND`) that prevent the default browser/contenteditable behavior (which tends to split blocks). Your setup lacks this override for CodeNodes, so pressing enter defaults to splitting the node (creating a new CodeNode). This is exacerbated by:
  - Missing or conflicting enter key handling (e.g., browser default or another plugin like MarkdownShortcutPlugin interfering).
  - The CodeHighlightPlugin alone isn't enough—it handles syntax highlighting (tokenization into spanned lines with `<br>` via mutation listeners) but *not* keyboard behavior.
  - Your custom setup (no RichTextPlugin or PlainTextPlugin mentioned) means no default enter handler, so browser quirks kick in, leading to splits.
- **Not the Transformer**: The `CODE` transformer from `@lexical/markdown` is for converting markdown syntax (e.g., ``````` fences) to/from CodeNodes during import/export or shortcuts. It's not involved in runtime keyboard events like enter. It supports multi-line just fine in standard setups.
- **Not the Theme**: Your `code` theme class (with margins/padding) might add spacing, but it wouldn't cause multiple `<pre>` elements—that's a node structure/rendering issue.
- **Known Lexical Behavior**: In the official playground, multi-line code works because it implicitly or explicitly handles `KEY_ENTER_COMMAND` (often via a full rich-text setup). Pressing enter inserts a LineBreakNode *within* the CodeNode (without splitting), and double-enter on an empty line exits to a ParagraphNode. Your setup is more minimal/custom, so this is missing.
- **Version Note**: You're on "0.33.1," but Lexical's latest stable is ~0.12.x (perhaps a typo?). If it's actually 0.12+, my advice still applies, as the code block mechanics haven't changed fundamentally.

This isn't a limitation of Lexical's markdown shortcuts—it's a common setup oversight in custom editors. Let's fix it.

### Step 1: Confirm the Node Structure Dynamically
Your debug shows a correct structure, but it might be stale. Add dynamic logging to verify:

```typescript
// In your editor component or a plugin
useEffect(() => {
  return editor.registerUpdateListener(({ editorState }) => {
    editorState.read(() => {
      console.log('Current node tree:', $getRoot().getChildren().map(node => node.exportJSON()));
    });
  });
}, [editor]);
```

- Type in a code block, press enter a few times, and check the console.
- If you see **multiple CodeNodes** (e.g., one per line), that confirms splitting is happening—proceed to Step 2.
- If it's truly one CodeNode with LineBreakNodes but still renders as multiple `<pre>`, inspect the DOM directly (e.g., via React DevTools or browser inspector) and check if your CodeNode's `createDOM` or `updateDOM` is overridden/customized (unlikely, but possible). Also test without your custom theme.

### Step 2: Add Enter Key Handling for Code Blocks
You need a plugin to override `KEY_ENTER_COMMAND` specifically for CodeNodes. This prevents splitting and inserts a LineBreakNode instead. It also handles "double-enter to exit" as in the playground.

Add this as a new component/plugin (e.g., `CodeBlockPlugin.tsx`):

```typescript
import {
  $createLineBreakNode,
  $createParagraphNode,
  $getNearestNodeOfType,
  $getSelection,
  $isRangeSelection,
  COMMAND_PRIORITY_EDITOR,  // Or LOW if you have conflicts
  KEY_ENTER_COMMAND,
  LexicalEditor,
} from 'lexical';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useLexicalComposerContext } from '@lexical/react/LexicalComposerContext';
import { $isCodeNode, CodeNode } from '@lexical/code';  // Assuming you're importing from @lexical/code

export function CodeBlockPlugin() {
  const [editor] = useLexicalComposerContext();

  useEffect(() => {
    return editor.registerCommand(
      KEY_ENTER_COMMAND,
      (event) => {
        return editor.update(() => {
          const selection = $getSelection();
          if (!$isRangeSelection(selection) || !selection.isCollapsed()) {
            return false;
          }

          const node = $getNearestNodeOfType(selection.anchor.getNode(), CodeNode);
          if (!$isCodeNode(node)) {
            return false;
          }

          if (event) {
            event.preventDefault();
          }

          // Get the current "line" content (from last linebreak to end)
          const children = node.getChildren();
          const lastChild = children[children.length - 1];

          // Check if we're on an empty line (for "double-enter to exit")
          const isEmptyLine =
            selection.anchor.offset === 0 &&
            (children.length === 0 ||
              ($isTextNode(lastChild) && lastChild.getTextContent() === ''));

          if (isEmptyLine) {
            // Exit code block: Remove empty code node and insert paragraph after
            const paragraph = $createParagraphNode();
            node.insertAfter(paragraph);
            paragraph.select();
            node.remove();
          } else {
            // Insert new line within the same code block
            const lineBreak = $createLineBreakNode();
            selection.insertNodes([lineBreak]);
          }

          return true;
        });
      },
      COMMAND_PRIORITY_EDITOR,  // Adjust priority if conflicting with other commands (e.g., LOW)
    );
  }, [editor]);

  return null;
}
```

- **Usage**: Add `<CodeBlockPlugin />` to your editor alongside `MarkdownShortcutPlugin` and `CodeHighlightPlugin`.
- **How It Works**:
  - Listens for enter key.
  - If inside a CodeNode and on a non-empty line, inserts a LineBreakNode (keeps everything in one CodeNode).
  - If on an empty line, exits to a new ParagraphNode (matches playground).
  - Prevents browser default (e.g., inserting rogue `<br>` or splitting).
  - The CodeHighlightPlugin will automatically re-tokenize and highlight the multi-line content (splitting into `<span>` + `<br>` in DOM).
- **Priority**: Start with `COMMAND_PRIORITY_EDITOR` (or `LOW` as you tried before). If another plugin (e.g., MarkdownShortcutPlugin) conflicts, raise it to `HIGH`.
- **Test**: Type ```` + space, type "Line 1", press enter → should add "Line 2" in same block. Press enter on empty line → exits.

This should resolve the splitting. It's not in `CodeHighlightPlugin`—that's purely for mutation/highlighting.

### Step 3: Other Fixes and Investigations
- **Compare to Playground**: The playground uses a fuller setup (e.g., RichTextPlugin, which might implicitly handle some keys). Clone the official playground repo, search for `KEY_ENTER_COMMAND` or `CodeNode`, and compare plugins/transformers. They don't use a separate "multi-line plugin"—it's command-based.
- **Minimal Reproduction**: Strip your editor to basics:
  ```typescript
  <LexicalComposer initialConfig={{ nodes: [CodeNode, CodeHighlightNode /* add LineBreakNode if needed */] }}>
    <CodeHighlightPlugin />
    <MarkdownShortcutPlugin transformers={TRANSFORMERS} />
    <CodeBlockPlugin />  // The new one above
    {/* No custom KeyDownPlugin or other interferers */}
  </LexicalComposer>
  ```
  Test enter behavior. If it works, add back components one-by-one to isolate.
- **Disable MarkdownShortcutPlugin Temporarily**: Remove it and manually create a CodeNode (e.g., via `editor.update(() => $createCodeNode())`). If enter works, the plugin might be interfering (e.g., misinterpreting new lines as new markdown triggers). In that case, customize the transformers or use a lower priority.
- **Theme Test**: Temporarily remove your `code` theme class. If rendering improves, something in the CSS (e.g., `display: block` on children) might be forcing visual splits.
- **Custom CodeNode?**: If you overrode CodeNode's methods (e.g., `insertNewAfter`, `canInsertAfter`, or `createDOM`), revert them. CodeNode should *not* split on enter by default if handled properly.
- **Browser/Env Specifics**: Firefox (especially in extensions) has contenteditable quirks with `<pre>`. Test in Chrome. If it's extension-related, ensure your Vite build isn't mangling DOM updates.
- **Alternative if This Fails**: Implement a custom transformer in `TRANSFORMERS` that explicitly handles multi-line code export/import, but this isn't necessary (it's a runtime issue, not serialization). Avoid custom CodeNode unless absolutely needed—stick to commands.

### Answers to Your Specific Questions
- **Known Limitation of Markdown Shortcuts?** No, not inherently. The shortcuts/transformers work with multi-line in standard setups (e.g., playground). The issue is keyboard handling, not markdown.
- **Additional Plugins Needed?** Yes—just the enter command handler (like my `CodeBlockPlugin` above). You don't need more beyond what you have (CodeHighlightPlugin handles highlighting).
- **Custom Transformer or CodeNode?** Not needed. Focus on commands first. If transformers are the culprit, debug by logging calls to `registerMarkdownTransformers`.
- **Config Differences from Playground?** Playground has a more complete plugin set (e.g., implicit enter handling via rich-text features). It uses the same `CODE` transformer but ensures no splitting via commands. No special theme overrides for code.

If this doesn't fix it, share the console output from my logging suggestion, your full plugin list, or a minimal repro code sandbox—I can refine further!
