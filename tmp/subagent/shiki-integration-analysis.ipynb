Key insights:\n\n1. **Shiki vs Prism Architecture Difference:**\n   - Prism provides structured token types (operator, comment, property, etc.)\n   - Shiki applies themes during tokenization and inlines styles as properties (color, etc.)\n   - Lexical expects structural token types, but Shiki only provides styled tokens\n\n2. **The Integration Challenge:**\n   - Shiki doesn't expose the structural token types that Lexical's CodeHighlightNode expects\n   - Shiki themes are TypeScript files called during tokenization, not CSS files\n   - Theme switching requires different integration patterns than Prism",
